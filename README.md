# Master's thesis 

Author: Eng. Agata Momot

Topic: Estimation of vessel size in ultrasound examination. 

Workplan: 
1. Collecting data (ultrasound images of carotid artery on different volunteer, longitudinally and transversely).
2. Prepare data (separation of a volumetric image .dicom into slices, images selection, images cropping).
3. Segmentation of carotid artery by neural network (Mask R-CNN):
      - ekspert's masks prepare,
      - data augumentation,
      - neural network learning,
      - neural network's parameter adjustment,
      - evaluation.
4. Acquisition protocol.
5. Measurement method of segmented carotid images.


Current progress in the folders below (11.02.2022):
1. Literature folder- contains one .pdf file with sources report (cited in the thesis).
2. Dataset folder- contains contains ultrasound images of carotid artery- open-source dataset and self-collected images on the ultrasound machine (Mindray UMT-500Plus). 
3. Latex folder- contains Latex files needed to get .pdf file with thesis. There is now theoretical introdution with cited sources.
